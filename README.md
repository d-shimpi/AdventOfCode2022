# Advent of Code 2022
Participating in the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)!

I'll do this in python since my python needs to be improved but is still somewhat decent. 

**Prompt for Advent of Code:**

>Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

>To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of *fifty stars* by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants *one star*. Good luck!

**Number of Stars: 0**
